# Introduction
The goal of this codelab is to develop a game store application from a html template. Users will be able to manage the games in the store.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this codelab, you should have the last [Dart Editor][1] Setup ready.

# Templates
The [Template HTML page][6] is composed of three main template blocks

- `GAME_TEMPLATE` displays the content of a game
- `GAMES_TEMPLATE` displays a toolbar and the games list:
  - The toolbar allows to search, filter, sort games and switch between the templates below
  - `GAMES_TEMPLATE_DETAILED` displays the games list reusing the `GAME_TEMPLATE`
  - `GAMES_TEMPLATE_COMPACT` displays the games list with a compact template
- `GAME_EDIT_TEMPLATE` displays a form to edit a game

See the [Live preview][6] and the [HTML source](../../blob/master/template/index.html)
